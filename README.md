# Game-of-Life-Simulator

## Overview
This project comprises a set of MATLAB scripts related to cellular automata simulations, focusing on the Game of Life and other related functionalities. It includes a Game of Life simulator, a GUI problem solver, and a Run-Length Encoding (RLE) decoder.

## Features
- `GOL.m`: Implements the Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton.
- `program_guiprob.m`: Provides a graphical user interface for solving problems or visualizing patterns.
- `RLE_decoder.m`: Decodes RLE encoded patterns for cellular automata simulations.

## Tech Stack
- MATLAB

## Libraries/Dependencies
- MATLAB Runtime
